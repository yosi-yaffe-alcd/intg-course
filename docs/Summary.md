## 🛠️ Integration Tips & Best Practices

### 🔐 Authentication
- Use **Client Credentials** flow for machine-to-machine integrations.
- Always **store tokens securely** and **rotate secrets** regularly.
- Use **external connected apps** for secure separation of apps/users.

### 🧑‍💻 Integration User
- Assign a **dedicated integration user** (not tied to any employee).
- Use **"Salesforce API Integration" license** (free and limited scope).
- Apply **least privilege access** via permission sets and IP ranges.
- Enable **login history** and **monitor API usage** in setup.

### 🌐 REST vs SOAP
| Criteria | REST | SOAP |
|---------|------|------|
| Simplicity | ✅ Simple | ❌ Verbose |
| Payloads | JSON/XML | XML only |
| Schemas | JSON Schema / OpenAPI | WSDL/XSD |
| Best for | Mobile, Web, Composite | Enterprise systems, strict contracts |

### 📦 Payload Design
- Match **data types** to Salesforce field types (e.g., `email`, `date`).
- Include **null checks** and **optional fields** when possible.
- Use external IDs for **upsert** operations.

### 📊 Monitoring & Logs
- Use **API Usage Report** and **Limits endpoint** to avoid throttling.
- Enable **debug logs** for integration user.
- Monitor **platform events and streaming** via Setup or CLI.
